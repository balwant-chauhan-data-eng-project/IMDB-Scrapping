# IMDb Top 250 Movies Scraping Project 🎬

## Step 1: Importing Required Libraries 📚
- **Importing Libraries**:  
  Start by importing essential libraries for our project:
  - **`re`**: Regular expressions module for string searching and manipulation.
  - **`requests`**: Library to send HTTP requests and fetch web content.
  - **`BeautifulSoup`**: From the `bs4` library, this is used for parsing HTML and XML documents, allowing us to navigate and search the parse tree easily.
  - **`pandas`**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis tool that enables us to work with structured data efficiently.

## Step 2: Define the URL and User Agent 🌐
- **Define the Target URL**:  
  Specify the URL of the IMDb Top 250 Movies page we want to scrape.
- **Set User-Agent**:  
  Create a headers dictionary that includes a User-Agent string. This string mimics a request from a web browser, which is often required by websites to allow access.

## Step 3: Fetch the HTML Content 📄
- **Sending a GET Request**:  
  Use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the defined URL, including the headers we set earlier.
- **Retrieve HTML**:  
  Extract the HTML content from the response, which will contain all the data we need.

## Step 4: Parse the HTML Using BeautifulSoup 🥣
- **Initialize BeautifulSoup**:  
  Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the fetched HTML content using the built-in HTML parser.
- **Extract Text**:  
  Use the `.text` property to extract all text from the parsed HTML, preparing it for further processing.

## Step 5: Define a Regex Pattern to Extract Movie Information 🧩
- **Crafting the Regex Pattern**:  
  Develop a regular expression (regex) pattern that outlines how to extract relevant movie details from the text. This pattern should account for:
  - Ranking number
  - Movie title
  - Year of release
  - Duration (optional)
  - Rating classification
  - Movie rating

## Step 6: Find Movie Information Using the Regex Pattern 🔍
- **Search for Matches**:  
  Utilize the regex pattern to find all occurrences of movie details within the text. This will return a list of tuples, each containing extracted information.

## Step 7: Create a List to Store Movie Details 🗃️
- **Initialize Movie List**:  
  Create an empty list that will store dictionaries containing detailed information for each movie.

## Step 8: Iterate Through the Extracted Movie Info 🔄
- **Looping Through Extracted Data**:  
  Iterate over the list of extracted movie information. For each entry:
  - **Create a Dictionary**: Construct a dictionary for each movie, including attributes like ranking, title, year of release, duration, and rating.
  - **Add to Movie List**: Append the created dictionary to the movie list.

## Step 9: Create a DataFrame from the List of Movie Details 📊
- **Convert to DataFrame**:  
  Use the `pandas` library to create a DataFrame from the list of movie dictionaries. This allows for easier data manipulation and analysis.

## Step 10: Display the DataFrame with Movie Details 📈
- **Render the DataFrame**:  
  Finally, display the DataFrame to visualize the movie details in a clear and organized tabular format, making it easy to analyze the top movies from IMDb.
